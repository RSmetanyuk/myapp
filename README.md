First JS application - myapp.

This application checks the strategy of answering next logical puzzle: Four were captured. Each person is written on his forehead a random number from 1 to 4. Persons put in a circle and say that they will be released ate at least one of them guesses the number written on his forehead. For guessing person can only look at the number of other persons without giving any signals. If no one guesses they will be shot. Since the risk is very high, they must develop a win-win strategy.


This application shows a list of possible 256 combinations of numbers in persons and who of them guessed the number on his forehead.
